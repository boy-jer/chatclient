Private Chat Room in ruby on rails 3.0
---------------------------------------

This sample will let you develop a private chatRoom using juggernaut. It push chats in realtime based on publish/subscribe model.


Resources:

Nodejs - http://nodejs.org/
Redis - http://code.google.com/p/redis/
Juggernaut - https://github.com/maccman/juggernaut/
JQuery - http://mirror.ozdiy.com/assets/b8/2f96a12bc919b37e09d303b86ea1b9_1251811910.html

Steps::

1. Install node-v0.2.5
	Download available at: http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.2.5.tar.gz
	
2  Install redis 2.0.4
	Download available at: http://code.google.com/p/redis/downloads/detail?name=redis-2.0.4.tar.gz&can=2&q=
 
3. Run Redis server
	./redis-server redis.conf
	
3  Install juggernaut
	git clone git://github.com/maccman/juggernaut.git --recursive
	cd juggernaut
	sudo node server.js
	
   Till this point, you would have all things in place except that juggernaut would still not be able to publish chats onto channels. This feature will get enabled after Step#5
   
4. Now you are ready to implement private chat app in RoR3. To get a sample chat application:
	git clone git://github.com/prabgupt/chatclient.git --recursive
	cd chatclient
	
5. To enable publishing by Juggernaut, run: bundle install

6. run rails server: rails server

open URLS: localhost:3000/chat/channel1
	   localhost:3000/chat/channel2
	   
channel1 and channel2 are assumed to be two users in this application who are trying to chat. You can multiple users likewise and can choose user IDs dynamically to open a unique channel between them.
